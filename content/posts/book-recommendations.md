Here are some books that have influenced me:

## Programming

- **Clean Code** by Robert Martin
- **The Pragmatic Programmer** by Hunt and Thomas
- **Design Patterns** by Gang of Four

## Productivity

- **Atomic Habits** by James Clear
- **Deep Work** by Cal Newport

## Business

- **Zero to One** by Peter Thiel
- **The Lean Startup** by Eric Ries

Reading regularly is one of the best investments you can make.
