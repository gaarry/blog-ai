Code review is one of the most important skills in software development. Here's how to do it right:

## Giving Reviews

1. **Be constructive** - Focus on improvements, not criticism
2. **Explain why** - Don't just say "change this", explain the reasoning
3. **Be specific** - Point to exact lines, not general areas

## Receiving Reviews

1. **Don't take it personally** - The code is not you
2. **Ask questions** - If you don't understand, ask
3. **Learn from it** - Every review is a learning opportunity

\`\`\`python
# Good code review comment:
# Consider using enumerate() here instead of range(len())
# because it makes the code more Pythonic and readable

# Bad code review comment:
# Change this

Good code reviews make better teams and better software.
