I've been into coffee for years. Here's my setup:

## Equipment

- **Grinder**: Comandante C40
- **Brewer**: V60 and Aeropress
- **Scale**: Acaia Pearl

## Methods

1. **V60** - For floral, bright coffees
2. **Aeropress** - For versatility
3. **Cold brew** - For hot days

Coffee is a ritual that starts my day right.
