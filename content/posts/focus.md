Deep work is increasingly rare and valuable. Here's how I practice it:

## Conditions

1. **Quiet environment** - Find or create one
2. **Time block** - 2-4 hour chunks
3. **Clear goal** - Know what you're working on

## Tools

- **Focus mode** on browsers
- **Do Not Disturb** on OS
- **Phone in another room**

## Mindset

Single-tasking beats multitasking every time.

Protect your focus time ruthlessly.
