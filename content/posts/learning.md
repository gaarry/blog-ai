Learning never stops. Here's my approach:

## 1. Start with Why

Understand the motivation before diving in.

## 2. Build Projects

The best learning comes from doing. Build something real.

## 3. Teach Others

Writing blog posts or mentoring reinforces understanding.

## 4. Repeat

Learning is a lifelong process.

Invest in yourself through continuous learning.
