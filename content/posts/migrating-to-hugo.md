After years of using different platforms, I finally decided to migrate to [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). Here's why:

## Why Hugo?

1. **Speed** - Hugo is incredibly fast
2. **Flexibility** - Full control over templates
3. **No Dependencies** - Single binary deployment

## The Migration Process

The migration wasn't straightforward, but it was worth it. I had to:

- Export content from previous platform
- Convert to Markdown
- Rewrite templates

\`\`\`bash
hugo new posts/my-new-post.md
\`\`\`

The result is a fast, reliable blog that I fully control.
