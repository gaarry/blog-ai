Here's my current photography setup:

## Camera

- **Main**: Sony A7 IV
- **Backup**: Fujifilm X-T5

## Lenses

- **24-70mm f/2.8** - Daily driver
- **35mm f/1.4** - Street photography
- **85mm f/1.4** - Portraits

## Accessories

- **Tripod**: Peak Design Travel Tripod
- **Bag**: Peak Design Everyday Backpack

Gear doesn't make the photographer, but the right tools help capture the vision.
