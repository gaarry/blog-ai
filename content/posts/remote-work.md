After years of working remotely, I've refined my setup. Here's what works for me:

## Hardware

- **Monitor**: 27" 4K display
- **Keyboard**: Mechanical keyboard with tactile switches
- **Mouse**: Ergonomic vertical mouse

## Software

- **Terminal**: Alacritty with tmux
- **Editor**: Neovim
- **Communication**: Slack, Zoom

## Tips

1. **Separate workspace** - Don't work from bed
2. **Take breaks** - Walk, stretch, rest your eyes
3. **Set boundaries** - Have a start and end time

The right setup makes all the difference in productivity.
