I started running three years ago. Here's what I've learned:

## Getting Started

1. **Start slow** - Your body needs time to adapt
2. **Consistency beats intensity** - Regular runs matter more than hard workouts
3. **Listen to your body** - Rest when needed

## Gear

- **Shoes** - Get fitted at a running store
- **Clothes** - Moisture-wicking fabrics
- **Watch** - Track your progress

## Benefits

Running has improved my:
- Physical health
- Mental clarity
- Sleep quality

Start small and build up gradually.
