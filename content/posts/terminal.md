A good terminal setup improves productivity. Here's mine:

## Shell

- **zsh** with **oh-my-zsh**
- **Starship** prompt

## Tools

- **tmux** - Terminal multiplexer
- **fzf** - Fuzzy finder
- **ripgrep** - Fast search

## Editor

- **Neovim** with custom config

The terminal is where I spend most of my time.
