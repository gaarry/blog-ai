Vim is a powerful text editor. Here are the basics:

## Movement

- `h j k l` - Left, down, up, right
- `w` - Next word
- `b` - Previous word
- `0` - Start of line
- `$` - End of line

## Editing

- `i` - Insert mode
- `Esc` - Normal mode
- `x` - Delete character
- `dd` - Delete line
- `yy` - Copy line
- `p` - Paste

## Search

- `/pattern` - Search forward
- `?pattern` - Search backward
- `n` - Next match
- `N` - Previous match

Vim takes time to learn but is worth it.
