Walking is underrated. Here's why I take walking breaks:

## Benefits

1. **Physical** - Movement counteracts sitting
2. **Mental** - Fresh ideas often come while walking
3. **Creative** - Walking boosts creativity

## My Routine

- 5-minute walk every hour
- 30-minute walk at lunch
- Weekend hikes when possible

Simple movement makes a big difference.
